# A christmas loop in svg

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/airnan/pen/WvaYEK](https://codepen.io/airnan/pen/WvaYEK).

This is an After Effects animation from the amazing Gabriel H Fermanelli. It's an ID for FOX.  
He shared the project and helped me on improving the plugin to support lots of new features.  
Watch it on Chrome or Opera. Firefox works really slow and Safari seems to have some bug I haven't figured out yet how to fix.  

Here's the link to this work:

About the framerate: this animation was not optimized for the plugin or real time rendering. It was exported as is as a proof of concept. It turned out pretty well considering all the layers and masks it has (around 200 masks). SVG on Chrome works great.
